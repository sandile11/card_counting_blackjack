# Card Counting using Computer Vision 
Repo for computer vision based card counting system

Below is a link to a repo with a similar project along with a link to a video-demo of their project:



1. can find a card
2. can locate and identify the suit for all numerically-valued cards
3. can give the numerical value of a card

## TO-DO

1. Add identification for cards that aren't numerically-valued
2. Adjust the system to detect cards using to corners of the image
